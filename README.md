## About This Project
This is my personal portfolio site, built to showcase my personal software engineering projects, experience, and expand a bit more about myself and my interests. If any of my interests also resonate with you, [reach out](mailto:samuel.c.glasscock@gmail.com) and let's see how we can collaborate to create something new and interesting!

## Tech Stack
Built with [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/), deployed via [Vercel](https://vercel.com/), and styled with [Tailwind](https://tailwindcss.com/).
